Intro to the DOM 
Objectives 
- Ecsplain in your own words what the DOM is and how it is created
- Use the document object to manipulate the DOM
- Iterate over DOM elements and add attributes 

What is the DOM?
From MDN:

- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML, XML and SVG documents. 
- It provides a structured representation of the document as a tree. 
- The DOM defines methods that allow access to the tree, so that they can change the document structure, style and content. 
- The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects, possessing various properties and methods. 
- Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them, and once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed. 
- Essentially, it connects web pages to scripts or programming languages.


- To access the DOM, we make use of the document object. 
- This object has properties and functions that we use to access our HTML elements which we can manipulate with JavaScript.


**********************
- Working with the DOM is one of the more fun parts about using JavaScript because we can add behavior to our web pages. 
- With JavaScript, we can change how a page looks and functions based on events the user makes (clicking, hovering, submitting a form, typing a certain key). 
- As you walk through the next couple sections, think about what you might be able to build with this new knowledge.

	- the easiest way to select elements is by thier id using the getElementById function on the document object (document.getElementById)
	- this returns a SINGLE element (because id's must be unique)
	- pass in the string container (no hashtag (ecspects to find element by id, in this case the hashtag isn't necessary))
	*/	
	var container = document.getElementById("container");
	

	/*
	- a function called querySelector, 
	- selects a SINGLE element using "CSS selectors" 
	- if multiple elements match the query you pass in to querySelector, 
		- the function will simply return the first matching element that it finds
	*/
	var container = document.querySelector("#container");



	/*
	- to select multiple elements 	
		- getElementsByTagName	
		- getElementsByClassName
		- querySelectAll
	- and then pass in a CSS selector
	*/
	var divs = document.getElementsByTagName("div");
	var divs = document.querySelectorAll("div");


	/*
	- another ecsample using:
		- getElementsByClassName 
		- querySelectorAll - takes in any valid CSS query
	*/
	var divsWithClassOfHello = document.getElementsByClassName("hello");
	var divsWithClassOfHello = document.getQuerySelectorAll(".hello");
