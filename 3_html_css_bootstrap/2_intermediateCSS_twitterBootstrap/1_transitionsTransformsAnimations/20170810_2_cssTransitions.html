CSS Transitions

Objectives:
- explain how to structure the "value" of the 'transform' porperty in CSS
- use the transition property to perform simple animation effects without using JavaScript




CSS Transitions
- another new technology
- allows ups to perform animations without using JavaScript! (great for more complex animatons)
- for simple things CSS animations can achieve the same effect

- there are many options about when you should use a CSS animation versus a JavaScript 
- to read more aobut the debate, read this article:

- CSS transitions are set using the "transition" property.
- they provide a way to set and control animation speed when changing CSS properties
- instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time

- Example: if you chnage the color of an element from white to black, usually the change is instanteous
- with CSS transition enabled, changes occure at time intervals that follow an acceleration curve, all of which can be customized
- read more about it here:

- CSS transitions
	- let you decide which properties to animate (by listing them explicitly)
	- when the animation will start (by setting a delay)
	- how long the transition will last (by setting a duration)
	- and how the transition will run (by defining a timing function, ex linearly, or quick at the beginning and slow at the end).

- you can also set transitions for multiple properties by comma separating values in the "transition" property.

Here is an example:


-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>Document</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css">
</head>

<body>
	<a href="">Click me!</a>
</body>
</html>
