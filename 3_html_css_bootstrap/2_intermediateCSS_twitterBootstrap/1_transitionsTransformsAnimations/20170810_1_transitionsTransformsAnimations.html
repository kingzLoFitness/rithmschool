CSS Transforms
•	new technology that allows you to move elements on the pages by:  
	⁃	translating them
	⁃	rotating them 
	⁃	scaling them
	⁃	and more
•	sometimes these transforms are used in isolation, but they’re more commonly fund in conjuction with CSS animations (next chapter)

- transform property - the only property known to use

- a variety of different values.  
- Overview:

	- CSS "transforms" chnage the shape and position of the affected content and allow you to
		- translate, rotate, scale and skew elements

	- a transformation is an effect that lets an element change shape, size and position.  Here are a few of the methods that can be "values of transform" property:

		- translate - the 'translate()' method moves an element from its current position.  
			- example: give an element the rule

				transform: translate(50px, 100px);
				- the element will be 50 pixels to the right and 100 pixels down



		- rotate - the 'rotate()' methodrotates an element clockwise or counter-clockwise according to a given degree.
	 		- Example: given an element, the rule 

				transform: rotate(90deg);
				- the element will rotate 90 degrees clockwise



		- scale - the 'scale()' method increases or decreases the size of an element (according to the parameters given for the width and height).  
			- Example: give an element the rule 

				transform: scale(2,3);
				- the element will scaled 200% horizontally and 300% vertically.


- an example of what these transforms look like in action. 
- this HTML page has two divs with identical content, but one is transformed:



NOTE: There are a number of otehr values that the transform property can take.
