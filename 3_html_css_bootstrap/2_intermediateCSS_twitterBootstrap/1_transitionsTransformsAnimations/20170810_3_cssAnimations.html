CSS Animations

Objectives
- explain what a keyframe is
- use the animation property along with @keyframes rules to create more complex CSS animations

Animations
- a little more complex in comparison to simple animation using CSS transitions
- a property called animations, used to define custom animations purely using CSS.  
- create complex animation transitinos from one CSS style configuration to another
- the following animation:

- 2 things to create animation
	- an animation property on the relevant HTML element
	- and a set of keyframes that describe the animation we're trying to build
		- keyframes literally describe key frames in the animation, around which the animations take place

- example: there are 3 key pints in the animation: when our div is a red circle, when it's a blue squer, and when it's a green (rotated) square

- when creating custom animations using keyframes, you need to give your animation a name before you build it.  
- in this case since our animation is changing, it's called "shapeshift"

- the "6s" indication how long it should take to complete animation
- the "infinite" ensures that the animation will play on loop, rather than stoping after one cycle

- there are actually 8 sub-properties that you can set inside of "animation"; here's an article on all of them:

- you can learn more about CSS Animations here:

NOTE: W3Schools is NOT a good resource for documentation in general, but they do have some helpful examples in this case

		/* Define what shapeshift should do.  In order to define this animation, we need to use the keyframes at-rule. 
		- this is the basic syntax for defineing custom animations using keyframes
		- inside the curly braces, we can define several different keyframes, which describe the state of our div at different points in the animatino
		- these points are described using percentages
		- example: we know that at the start and end of our animation, the ball div should be red and round */
