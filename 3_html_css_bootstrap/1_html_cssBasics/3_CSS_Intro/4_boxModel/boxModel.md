we should meet up somewhere.  I'm actually in the middle of coding though.  So I can't get to that pussy at the momment.  Leave a message (with your lips on my cocky).


she's not feeling you like that.  But you can run as WILD as you wish, within your imagination.

As she accidentally hits me (just a little tap on my bicycle).  She comes out of her jeep, tells me to lay on the ground gently.  She puts her hands upon my lap and massages my legs towards my crutch.  She reaches for my zipper, and I'm just tense from the moment she let go to reach over for her massage was soothing as soon a she layed her hands on me.  As she unzips my zipper, I'm not thinking to relax, but something came over me.  And it wasn't a feeling of hesitation, it was something else...  I was about to get some head.

What can I say about that moment in time?
Do I continue to another scene or do I continue with some details and go from there?

Another Scene is she can simply pick me up and we can make love in her garage (in her jeep (and  the jeep is acually a lexus.  It's just that all SUV's ahs been conquered still with being called a Jeep (or is that just me))).


Let's go back over CSS.  I have an HTML layout that is in need of such works.  That includes this Solo Project at hand.  I'm going from Pseudo-Code onwards, from the top down.


What else am I figuring out further along?

I've been writing thus far.  And it is similar to Writing alltogether.  This is similar to how a Pianist would play the Piano, like how one plays at church.  


My imagination is still running wild with Marcy in mind.  Her pussy is pounding.
