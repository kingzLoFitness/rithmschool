# Vertical-align

- table-cell value
    - used to vertically align an element to the middle of its container
    - it can be a pain though, in general

    - the key here is that when an element's display is set to table-cell, it respects a new property, called vertical-align
        - lets you adjust the vertical alignement of the element
        - NOTE: Try commenting out the display properties in the two divs above, and see how that affects the layout
