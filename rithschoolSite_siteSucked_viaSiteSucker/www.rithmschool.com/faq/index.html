        <div class="question">
            How is the program structured?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            Rithm’s web development program is a four-month experience that will support you as you become a confident and creative developer. For the first three months, you’ll be in the classroom full-time learning to code with 8-16 other students. We cap our student-teacher ratio at 4:1 so that you’ll have plenty of opportunities to code with experienced programmers. For the final month, you’ll be preparing to enter the competitive job market with Outco and their team of highly qualified mentors. Outco’s classes are part-time and in the evening, meaning you’ll be able to  dedicate your days to the application process and interviews.

        <div class="question">
            Why JavaScript and Python Development?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
        We believe it does not matter what language you learn as a student. We’re more interested in teaching you how to never stop learning. That being said, we chose JavaScript and Python because they are foundational languages that easily facilitate conversations about core programming concepts. We are also in constant conversation with our hiring partners, and we know what kind of developers they want to hire. Right now, JavaScript and Python developers are in demand.
        </div>
        <!-- <div class="question">
            What is the difference between the part-time and four-month courses?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            Our part time time program is a XX week night class that begins with foundational HTML/CSS and will end with advanced JavaScript concepts. Essentially, it covers the prework and the first month of the four-month program’s curriculum. The web development program is full-time for three months and followed by one month of part-time interview prep classes. If you start with our part-time program, fall in love with web development, and want to transfer into the four-month program… we’d love that! We’ll apply your tuition from the part-time to the four-month program.

        </div> -->
        <div class="question">
        Why is your program 18 weeks (unlike typical bootcamps which are 12 weeks)?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
        We think 13 weeks is the perfect length of time to dive deeply into programming. Any longer than that and students tend to lose focus and burn out. We add an additional four weeks of part-time classes dedicated to interview prep so that you’ll have plenty of time and energy to concentrate on finding your first development job while still getting the support you need. <a href="../program/index.html">Look at our Program in Detail.</a>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            Why do you partner with Outco?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            We’re teachers. We’re developers. What we do best is teach web development. We’ve partnered with Outco because they shine when it comes to supporting software developers through the rigorous job search process. <a href="../outcomes/index.html">See how Outco will help you become a competitive candidate.</a>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            If I get in to Rithm, am I guaranteed acceptance into Outco?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            Acceptance into our full-time course does not guarantee you a spot in Outco's four-week program. All Rithm students will need to go through Outco's application process; typically this occurs during the last two weeks of Rithm's twelve-week immersive. Having said that, we're confident that if you can make it through our program, you'll be able to make it through Outco's admissions process and excel in their program too. If, for some reason, you don't get in to Outco the first time around, you're encouraged to apply again (Outco starts new classes every month).
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="students"><h2>Students & Culture</h2>
        <div class="question">
            What kind of students will thrive at Rithm?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            <p>Rithm strives to cultivate a strong learning community where each individual student is a self-motivated, curious, and persistent learner. Web development is challenging, and your success will be largely determined by your ability to continue to stay engaged with your code despite a seemingly never-ending series of stumbling blocks.</p>
            <p>Great programmers come from all walks of life, and we find that the thing that they all have in common is a positive attitude under pressure.</p>
            <p>Rithm wants you to succeed. If you fall behind in your coursework in the first 6 weeks, we’ll begin a conversation with you to decide whether or not it’s worth your time, energy, and money to continue. If it makes more sense to part ways, we’ll return your tuition (less your deposit) - no harm, no foul.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            What backgrounds do students come from?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            We’ve taught students of all ages and backgrounds. It’s common for students to have had exciting lives and careers before transitioning into software development. We’ve taught musicians, Hot Topic employees, Uber drivers, lawyers, massage therapists, veterans,scientists, and more!
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            Bootcamps are intense. How do you prevent student burnout?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            <p>
            As teachers, we know that students need rest in order to be receptive to new information. During classroom hours, you’ll be coding with your peers and instructors and we expect that you’ll get the majority of work done in this supportive environment.
            </p>
            <p>
            What’s more, we don’t recommend coding all night. In fact, we close our space at 8pm. There are resources and reading materials we’ll ask you to review at home, and we do that so that you’ll be able to maximize the time during the day when you have access to our instructional staff.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
        What’s a typical day like for a student?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            As a student, you’ll spend a lot of time pair programming, working through our curriculum or on your own projects. Instructors will lecture on concepts and lead the class through code reviews.  Periodically, there will be events and guest lectures that students will have the option of attending. Our classroom is located in the Mission District, so there are lots of opportunities to get out of the classroom for great food or to take a break in sunny Dolores Park.
        </div>

    </div>

    <div id="required"><h2>What's Required</h2>
        <div class="question">
        What is the full-time program commitment?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            <p>We ask a lot of our students. There are 70-100 hours of prework to be completed before your program starts. You’ll spend three full months in class; days will be approximately 9-6, although you’re welcome to spend evenings at Rithm until 8pm. After that, you’ll be shifting your focus to the job hunt. Classes will be held at night at Outco (in the Financial district) for 12 hours per week.</p>

            <p>Financially, the commitment is your initial deposit of $3,000, due when you’re admitted to Rithm, plus the balance of your tuition, payable in 1 or 2 installments. You can either pay the $21,000 upfront or make two payments of $11,000 (due on the first day of week one) and $10,500 (due on the first day of week seven). Note that if you pay in two installments, the payments include an additional $500 fee.
            <a href="../program/index.html#tuition">Take a look at our lending partners who can help you finance your tuition.</a>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
        What is the prework? How much time will it take?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            <p>We tell students to budget 70-100 hours for the prework. We’ve designed this take-home curriculum to lead you through Terminal Basics, Git/GitHub, HTML, CSS, and foundational JavaScript. You’ll learn how to navigate these technologies on your own, so that by the time step into the Rithm classroom you’ll be ready to take full advantage of our instructors’ expertise and level-up fast.</p>

            <p>We offer four hours of 1:1 instruction to keep you on track. You’ll be able to schedule this time with instructors during the month before your program’s start. Doing the prework is vital to your success at Rithm, and so if it is left undone, we’ll revoke your admission. We’re strict in order to prevent anyone from starting at a disadvantage on day one.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            What kind of computer do I need for the program?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            You’ll need a Mac laptop that’s newer than 2012.
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            What is the policy on missing class due to illness or special events?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            The days here are packed with instructional content and experiential learning. It’s possible to catch up if you miss a day or two due to illness, but it’s challenge to miss much more than that.
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            How long will it take me to get a job after graduation?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            We’ve seen students receive job offers before graduation. However, finding your first development position is an arduous process and we recommend that people budget for 2-3 months of full-time job hunting.
        </div>

    <div id="finance"> <h2>Financing Your Tuition</h2>
        <div class="question">
            Are there loan options? Who do I talk to about student loans?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            We work with <a href="http://rithmschool.skills.fund" target="_blank">Skills Fund</a> to help students finance their tuition. <a href="../program/index.html#tuition">You can learn more about them here.</a>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            How much is tuition?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
             <p>The cost of our program depends on whether or not you plan on attending Outco. Attendance to Outco is strongly encouraged, but is not required.</p>

                </ul>

        <div class="question">
            Do I have to pay for Outco separately?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            <li>No. Your tuition for Outco is included in your admission to Rithm.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            When is tuition due?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            Your non-refundable deposit of $3,000 is due upon admission to secure your place and receive the prework. You can either pay the remaning balance of $21,000 up front or in two installments of $11,000 due on the first day of class and $10,500 due on the first day of the seventh week of class. Note that if you pay in two installments, the payments include an additional $500 fee.

        <div class="question">
            What is the Separate Ways Clause?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            <p>We look at the first six weeks of our course as an indicator of your success at Rithm. And so, if your progress doesn’t keep pace with the curriculum, we’ll start a conversation with you to determine whether or not you should remain a student. If necessary,  your time at Rithm will come to an end early and we’ll offer you a full refund (minus your enrollment deposit).</p>
            <p>We designed this policy to ensure that every student in the program is thriving. We want to offer students who might struggle with the pace of the course a way out without sacrificing the majority of their tuition. We believe our Separate Ways Clause is beneficial to the students who remain in the class; it’s understood that everyone in the classroom is there because they want to be, are willing to do the work, and are at a comparable skill level.</p>

        <div class="question" id="tuition-refund">
            How does the Job Guarantee work? Will my tuition be reimbursed if I don’t land a developer job?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            <p>If you do not land a job (either full-time, contractor, contract-to-hire, or internship) as a developer within six months of completing Outco, we’ll completely refund your tuition (minus your enrollment deposit). </p>

            <p>To be eligbile for this refund, you must adhere to the following:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>You must be admitted to and complete Outco's program.</li>
            <li>You must reply to messages from Rithm or Outco regarding outcomes within 48 hours.</li>
            <li>You must apply to at least fifteen software development jobs per week and submit weekly logs to Rithm summarizing the jobs you have applied to and their current application status.</li>
            <li>You must log all job-related correspondence. Should you not find a job within six months, you must provide details relating to each employer, job title, application date, and application status. </li>
            <li>You must be fluent in English (both speaking and writing) and you must be eligible to work in the country you choose for 18 months after your graduation.</li>
            <li>You must be willing to accept a job in web development if you are offered one. If you decline a role in the field, you forfeit your reimbursement.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            Does Rithm offer financial aid?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            <p>No. Rithm doesn’t currently offer financial aid. However, we do offer a scholarship:</p>

            <p>The Rithm Diversity Scholarship awards up to $5,000. Students of all backgrounds are eligbile to apply and the scholarship is awarded based on merit as well as need. Students can apply for this scholarship upon admisson to the program.</p>

    <div id="application"> <h2>Application</h2>
        <div class="question">
            How do I begin?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            If you’re ready for an intensive educational experience that will catapult you into the world of software development… submit a preliminary application <a href="../apply/index.html">here</a> to Rithm! It’s that easy. We’ll get back to you within 24 hours with a few follow up questions. That’s all you need to get started.
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            What is the application process?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            <p>
                The process has multiple steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fill out a preliminary application online, we’ll get back to you within 24 hours.</li>
                <li>Have a brief phone conversation with someone on the team, we want to get to know you!</li>
                <li>Come meet one of our instructors for a brief technical interview. We’re not focused on how much you already know, but how you think about solving problems.</li>
                <li>Meet the entire instructional team for a more in depth interview. Get to know us better and together we’ll determine if it’s a good fit.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            Can I come visit?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            We love to meet potential candidates. Come join us for any of our public events before or after you apply. During the application process, if you seem like a good fit for Rithm’s upcoming class, we’ll schedule two interviews so that you’ll have a chance to meet the whole team before making your final decision to enroll.
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            What if I'm accepted and I don't finish the prework on time?
        </div>
        <div class="answer hidden">
            The prework is essential to your success at Rithm. The first day of class starts with intermediate level material. And so, if your prework isn’t finished beforehand, we sadly will have to revoke your admission to Rithm, and you won’t be allowed to begin the program.
